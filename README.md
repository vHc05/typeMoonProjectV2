# TypeMoon GUIDE HTML/CSS/JS

All this files consist in a simple HTML page that points to kinda recreate the Type-Moon website.

I has planed to add a video player for the episodes and extend the number of seasons the page has.

If you want in the page "Contactanos" you can send your favorite serie for us to add it to the page.

The edit function of the form may be a little confusing, but when you click the edit button all the information move to the form again and then you can edit your information.
The form have all the CRUD functions.
